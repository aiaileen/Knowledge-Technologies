# Project 1: waht wierd spelings! aer peaple carzy?

In this project, you will be tasked with comparing and analysing the performance of spelling correction methods, on a peculiar data set: a number of headwords taken from UrbanDictionary 1 that have been automatically identiﬁed as being misspelled (Saphra and Lopez, 2016). In particular, you must:

• Apply two (or more) spelling correction methods

• Evaluate the behaviour of the methods (for example, using Accuracy), and ﬁnd some particular headwords that clearly demonstrate the behaviour of each method

• Write a technical report detailing your observations
